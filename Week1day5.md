Ensure in future you track the time you spend on anything to do with the bootcamp.
	-A database will eventually be created from this.

You can file feedback (and complaints) through Nick if you like.

Slack has a notification bell that can make notifications ping you on your desktop. (Bell is located at the upper left hand corner)


Jekyll: If you are having problems with jekyll recreate all of your directories on github and on your computer and reinitialize everything in the folder to create the necessary Jekyll files. Push these files to a new username.github.io. After doing so you should be able to navigate to your username.github.io. Place your blog post into the _post folder and make sure you use the following naming scheme: year-month-day-[filename].markdown. If after following those steps open your _config.yml with any text editor and add the following to the bottom of the page: future: true. After doing all of the above you should be able to push this to your username.github.io and then load the page and it should work.
