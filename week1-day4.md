###Learning points from warmups

* Ternary pops up again. Early running for class favorite
* Filter method for arrays Ex: arr.filter((a) => a > 0) returns an array of items from the original array (a) that meet the condition (a >0) 

##Morning Standup

1. Scoreboard - Cha'Sed
  * Drop down selectors
  * Player matchups
  * Hole by hole winners
  * Need for method to repeat the table to streamline code
  * Design for mobile first
  * Design to store locally and push data when connection is present
  * Gonna need some javascript to make this puppy bark
  * Not recording at this point (10:19am)

2. Hackathon - scorecards/game entry (revisit on Friday, June 1)
  * develop multiple mockups to test for design and basic function to decide between competing choices
3. Calendar
  1. Each user has a calendar
  2. Users can select and filter which calendars should be shown
  3. Can be modular since it is not unique to disc golf
