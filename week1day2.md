### 3 Different Ways to Add Style

3)Create CSS stylesheet

### Normalize

For normalize.css there are two ways to use the file:

Download at necolas.github.com/normalize.css/ OR
GRAB from github at https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/
Then save normalize.css to your project folder

                   AND THEN

link to it in the HTML file ABOVE your main style sheet

                      OR 

import into main style sheet "@import 'normalize.css'"
